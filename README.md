Parking Booking System

    A Dynamic web application known as “Vehicle Parking Booking System” is proposed for those who lives in Metropolitian cities and are really sick of looking for a parking slot at any corner of city. In order to handle this entire process we have developed this application. The main objective of this design is to highlight the requirements and to provide guidelines regarding looking for an empty or available parking lots as of their needs and book any lot selecting the time of their requirement. Admin can manage all the bookings online, Where the customer can search for his required parking lot availability that he can get a real time information about and he can also book the parking lot selecting a valid time period by using this web application. And on the other hand admin can add new parking places where he can give the new availability across the city for the customers.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79695204/227699602-04221ea0-ade5-4441-adda-eae2a54c4b4f.png)


    According to the proposed system the customer(user) will be provided with the application where he can check for the availability of parking lots at any place and at any time, and he can also book his lot selecting a valid time period for which he may use it. Even the admin can access easy track of bookings proceeded on a particular day.


    This project helps the customer to save their time in search of parking areas, he can directly use the application to check the availability of the parking place, and he can book the parking place at his required timings, and there will be no reason to worry about the parking place. So, this project helps to simplify the parking procedure for urban societies and save their precious time
